What have I learnt?
This week I have learnt about if and switch statements and how to apply them in javascript code. 

Why have I learnt this?
I have learnt this so I can use if and swtich staements in javascript. If and switch statements are very well used JS statements and are crucial for adavanced JS scripts. 

How have I learnt this?
I have learnt this by reading information about these JS statements in the provided gitbook. I have also created the code in lab 3 to specification. 

What do I know now that I didn't know before?
I did not know about the switch statement before this week. I feel it is very clean looking compared to if and easier to use for specific strings/values. 


What new understanding/skills have you gained?
I have gained skills in applying switch statements. I feel that having knowledge of this statement earlier on in my learning of coding would have been very useful since they are easier to use with specific strings and values. 

What are the real life/work applications?
Since these statements are really fundemental to general coding I feel that I will be using these in all aspects of a coding career.
